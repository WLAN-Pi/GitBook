# WLANPi support

As this project is provided by a team of volunteers, any support around the configuration and operation of your WLANPi is provided on a best-efforts basis.

If you have hardware issues, you will need to contact the supplier of your hardware.

For all other issues the best ways to contact the team are:

* via Twitter \(hashtag \#WLANPi or Twitter account [@WLANPi](https://www.twitter.com/WLANPi)\)
* the Wireless LAN Pros Slack group \(it has a \#WLANPi channel - [@Sam Clements](https://www.twitter.com/samuel_clements) may be able to get you set up with an account if needed\).

Another option may be to have a look through [GitHub](https://github.com/WLAN-PI) and see if you can find the original author of the module you are having issues with and drop them a note.
