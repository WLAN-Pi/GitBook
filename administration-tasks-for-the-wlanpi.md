# Administration Tasks For the WLAN Pi

Administering your WLAN Pi can be a challenge to those who are not too comfortable with operating on the Linux command line \(CLI\). Over time we aim to move more towards GUI-based administration, but in the meantime there will undoubtedly be times when you'll need to roll up your sleeves and execute a few CLI commands.

In this section, we'll provide access to a number of tech notes to provide guidance on how to perform the more common administration tasks you'll need for your WLAN Pi.
